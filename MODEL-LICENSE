DMind-3-Nano-270M Model License Agreement
Version 1.0, February 2026
Copyright (c) 2026 DMind

Section 1: Preamble
DMind is an open-source AGI research organization focused on next-generation digital finance. Driven by real market needs, DMind continuously releases open-source products—including large language models, benchmarks, datasets, tools, and more.

As an open, research-driven community, DMind is powered by a global collective of AI and Web3 enthusiasts, builders, and researchers. All of our work is released under permissive licenses, enabling individuals and enterprises alike to freely use, adapt, and build upon them to create new AI-native innovations.

DMind-3-Nano-270M is a small, edge-optimized language model fine-tuned for crypto wallet and DEX intent recognition using standardized function-calling protocols. It is designed to run entirely on-device, enabling privacy-preserving, low-latency intent parsing for Web3 wallets and local agents. The model enforces a minimal set of typed tools (SEARCH_TOKEN, EXECUTE_SWAP) with strict schemas and a deterministic wrapper output format. DMind-3-Nano-270M is derived from the google/functiongemma-270m-it base model and contains approximately 270M parameters.

This license is designed to enable open and responsible use of DMind-3-Nano-270M. It grants broad rights to use, modify, and redistribute the model, while also enforcing responsible-use provisions to prevent misuse.
